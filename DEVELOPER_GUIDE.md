## 1. Introduction

The Leonex Material Hub is a web application designed to facilitate the structured cataloguing and assessment of material inventory based on defined conditions and material codes. This guide provides the technical foundation necessary to understand, modify, and extend the system.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The project follows a client-server architecture, likely implemented as a Single Page Application (SPA) frontend communicating with a RESTful API backend.

*   **Frontend:** The user interface, built using a modern JavaScript framework, handles user interactions, data presentation, and communication with the backend API.
*   **Backend (API):** Handles business logic, data storage (database interaction), user authentication and authorization, file uploads, and serves data to the frontend via RESTful endpoints.
*   **Database:** Stores all application data, including user information, plant details, material master data, and the dynamic submission and estimation records.
*   **File Storage:** A system for storing uploaded images and videos associated with material submissions.

*Note: Total values can be calculated on retrieval or stored for performance.*

## 5. Authentication & Authorization (JWT)

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for managing user sessions and access control.

### Login Process

1.  User sends `POST` request to `/api/auth/login` with `username` and `password`.
2.  Backend verifies credentials against the `users` table.
3.  If valid and `active`, backend generates a JWT containing claims:
    *   `user_id`
    *   `username`
    *   `role` (e.g., 'admin', 'cataloguer', 'third_party')
    *   `plant_id` (if applicable, NULL for Admin)
    *   `exp` (expiry timestamp)
4.  The token is returned to the frontend, usually in the response body or an `Authorization` header.
5.  The frontend stores the token (e.g., in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`).
