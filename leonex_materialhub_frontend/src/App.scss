// src/App.scss
// This file is the main entry point for all your SASS/SCSS styles.
// It imports main.scss from the scss directory, which then orchestrates all other imports.

@use "./scss/main";

// If you're not importing react-toastify.css in your JS (e.g., App.jsx or main.jsx),
// and prefer a global SCSS import, you could do it here.
// However, JS import is generally recommended for CSS related to JS libraries.
// @import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css';
